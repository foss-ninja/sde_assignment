## Problem Statement
At Mindtickle, a client has requested a custom report that lists all active users on the platform and the number of daily lessons they have completed in the last 1 year. Your task is to create a Python script to generate this report and save it in an AWS S3 Bucket.

The data for this report is spread across two different databases: PostgreSQL and MySQL. You are not required to create the database, but you have access to the docker-compose file which will create the sample databases for you.

Criteria:
1. Understanding of the problem.
2. Correctness and efficiency of the solution
3. Clarity of the code written.

**Note:**
- Follow all the best practices you would follow for a production grade code.
